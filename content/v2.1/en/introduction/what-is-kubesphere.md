## Overview

**KubeSphere** is a multi-tenant enterprise-grade container platform built on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. KubeSphere provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a more robust and feature-rich platform, which includes most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategy, such as the **Kubernetes resource management, DevOps (CI/CD), application lifecycle management, monitoring, logging, Service Mesh (Istio-based), multi-tenancy, alerting and notification, storage and networking, autoscaling, access control, GPU support, etc.**, as well as **multi-cluster management, Network Policy, registry management, more security enhancements** in upcoming releases. KubeSphere is a **distributed operating system with cloud native stack** with Kubernetes as its kernel, and will be very well architected for **plug-and-play integration for third-party applications to boost its ecosystem**.

KubeSphere team works with its users to alleviate the pain points of Kubernetes including **storage, network, security and ease of use**, and develops new features and capabilities that are not yet available in upstream Kubernetes. KubeSphere provides a complete user experience around Kubernetes that incorporates a set of cloud native ecosystem tools, allowing developers and DevOps teams use their favorite tools in a unified console. KubeSphere delivers **consolidated views while integrating a wide breadth of ecosystem tools** around Kubernetes and offers consistent user experience to reduce complexity. Most importantly, these functionalities are loosely coupled with the platform since they are pluggable and optional at your will. Last but not least, it does not change Kubernetes itself anything. In another word, KubeSphere can be deployed on any existing version-compatible Kubernetes cluster.

With KubeSphere container platform, developers can focus on application development since KubeSphere helps your enterprise migrate, deploy and manage existing and containerized apps seamlessly across **virtual machine, bare metal, Kubernetes, on-premise and public cloud** infrastructures. This platform also helps your Ops team with enterprise-level **observability and troubleshooting, unified monitoring and logging, centralized storage and networking management, easy-to-use CI/CD pipelines**, letting IT operation team embrace DevOps and automated workflows.

## What's New in 2.1

We have decoupled some main feature components and makes them being pluggable. Meanwhile, there are great enhancements in Helm application store, especially in application lifecycle management.

It's worth mentioning that both **DevOps** and **observability** components have been improved significantly. For example, we added lots of new features including Binary-to-Image, dependency cache support in pipeline, support switch branch and Git logs output within DevOps component. We also bring upgrade, enhancements and bugfix in storage, authentication and security, as well as user experience improvements. See [Release Notes For 2.1.0](../../release/release-v210) for details.

## Open Source

As we adopt open source development model, development is completed in the open way and has been driven by KubeSphere community, and the source code is available on GitHub. This open collaboration fosters rapid innovation and development.

> Note: All the relevant source codes and documents are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere).



## Roadmap

**Express Edition => KubeSphere 1.0.x => KubeSphere 2.0.x => KubeSphere 2.1.0 => KubeSphere 2.1.1 => KubeSphere 3.0.0**

> Note: All versions of KubeSphere are **100% open source** and free which has been providing services for a great scale of user community, and it has been widely installed and used in development testing and production environments. A large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere.
