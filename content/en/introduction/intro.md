## What's New in 2.0

In contrast to the express edition, [KubeSphere 2.0](../../release/release-v200) provides richer services for application management, supports multiple functions and flexible configuration to meet the complex business requirements. It supports **master and etcd node HA, visualized CI/CD pipeline, multi-dimensional monitoring and logging, multi-tenancy management, LDAP integration**. Additionally, It adds the supports for **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), container health check and configurations for Secrets and ConfigMaps** etc. 

The newly added functions include microservice governance, grayscale release, S2I and code quality analysis, etc. What also deserves expecting is **multi-cluster management, big data, AI** and other more complex business scenarios in future releases.

## Open Source

KubeSphere has been developing by applying the open source approach since the very beginning. All the relevant source codes and documents are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere). KubeSphere supports installing on **public cloud, private cloud, VM, BM, Kubernetes and any other infrastructures**. Besides, it supports online and offline installation, which has been tested on **AWS, Google Cloud and Kubernetes, Aliyun, Tencent cloud, Huawei cloud, QingCloud**.


## Roadmap

**Express Edition => KubeSphere 1.0.x => KubeSphere 2.0.x => KubeSphere 2.1.0 (Coming soon!)**

> Note: All versions of KubeSphere are **100% open source** and free which has been providing services for a great scale of user community, and it has been widely installed and used in development testing and productions environments centered around Docker and Kubernetes. A large number of services are running smoothly in KubeSphere.
