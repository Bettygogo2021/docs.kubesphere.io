## Separation of front and back ends

KubeSphere adopts the separation of front and back ends, also realizes a cloud native design, the back ends' service components can communicate with external systems through the REST API, see [API documentation](/api/kubesphere) for more details. All component are included in the architecture diagram below. KubeSphere can run anywhere from on-premise datacenter to any cloud to edge. In addition, it can be deployed on any Kubernetes distribution.

## Components List

| Back-end component | Function description |

## 3rd Party Tools

In addition to the components listed above, KubeSphere also supports [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) as optional installations that you can install according to your project requires.

## Service Components

Each component has many service components, see [Service Components](../../infrastructure/components) for more details.
